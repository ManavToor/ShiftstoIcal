<h1>Microsoft Teams Scraper</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
At my part-time job, my work schedule was posted on Microsoft Teams. I wanted them to apear on the Apple Calendar app on my iphone but there was no way to do so, so I made a bot that did it for me<br />
<br />
<b>This is my web scraper:</b><br /><br />
  &emsp;&emsp;-Logs into my MS Teams account and gets all my shifts from the previous, current, and following months. Puts them into JSON files<br /><br />
  &emsp;&emsp;-Takes those shifts and converts them into an ical file<br /><br />
  &emsp;&emsp;-Uploads the ical file to dropbox<br /><br />
  &emsp;&emsp;-I subscribed to the dropbox link on the ical app on my phone and all my shifts show up :)<br /><br />
 
<br />
I made this all by myself!<br />
